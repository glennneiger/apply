apply
=====

Simple nodejs server to advertise and accept job applications for developers.  I have always stuggled to find a good way to "test" some developers on how quickly they can come up to speed on a new API.  Saw an idea that parse.com use to allow applications from an API.  I thought that was a great idea.


Usage
====

npm start
mocha

Customizing
==========

You can set up your own custom application/job schema by changing the api.json file.

Setup 
=======

create a job

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"job" :{"position":"developer","discription":"we need someone who can write elegant, well tested code."}}' http://0.0.0.0:8080/jobs
