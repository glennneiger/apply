apply
=====

Simple nodejs server to advertise and accept job applications for developers.  I have always stuggled to find a good way to "test" some developers on how quickly they can come up to speed on a new API.  Saw an idea that parse.com use to allow applications from an API.  I thought that was a great idea.


Usage
====

npm start
npm test

Customizing
==========

You can set up your own custom application schema by changing the api.json file.
